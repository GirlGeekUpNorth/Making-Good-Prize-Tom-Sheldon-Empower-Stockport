<h1 class="blue">ABOUT US</h1>
<h1 class="black">Empower Stockport was orginally formed in 2023 as 'Proud Heatons' as a solution to the problem in the lack of groups for disabled people in the
    Heatons area of Stockport. Our mission is simple: to give those with disabilties a safe, fun and welcoming environment in which to make friends. 
We host a variety of events throughout the year inlcuding monthly quizzes, bowling alley trips, days out to local landmarks and our cosy cafe meetups
in Stockport, where you are free to relax and unwind after a hard day's work! </h1>
